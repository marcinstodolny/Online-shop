## Task Sprints

### Sprint 1: Building the Foundation

In the first sprint, we laid the foundation for our Online Shop. We set up the development environment using Visual Studio and .NET, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture. The database was created using Microsoft SQL Server to store product information and user data.
