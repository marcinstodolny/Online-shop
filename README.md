## Task Sprints

### Sprint 1: Building the Foundation

In the first sprint, we laid the foundation for our Online Shop. We set up the development environment using Visual Studio and .NET, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture. The database was created using Microsoft SQL Server to store product information and user data.

### Sprint 2: Enhancing User Experience

In the second sprint, we focused on enhancing the user experience. We integrated Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing frontend. Users can now log in, access their abandoned shopping carts, and view their order history, making their shopping journey more convenient and personalized.
